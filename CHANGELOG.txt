[1.2.1] Update density table to xillverD-5.fits and change number of
Gamma bins accordingly (now Gamma extends up to 3.6)

[1.2.0] IMPORTANT reverting the wrong change for the emissivity
profile, in 1.1.0, change (1). Besides this change, the environment
variable RELLINE_PHYSICAL_NORM has been added. If set to 1, it will
return the acutal normalization of the relline and relconv type models
(not recommended for fitting).

[1.1.0] major update and bug fix for the lamp post version of relxill:

  (1) the emissivity profile in the lamp post geometry has been
    corrected, leading to a steeper radial dependency

  (2) fixing a wrong normalization of the reflected spectrum, mainly
  affecting models with a large inclination angle

  (3) removing the re-normalization with RENORM_RELXILL_MODEL

  (4) updating the relativistic table, to achieve a more precise
  calculation of relativstic blurring for very low inclinations

[1.0.4] only applies to the LP model flavors fixed inconsistencies and
problems with the normalization of the reflection component of
relxilllp</tt> and <tt>relxilllpCp</tt>, affecting only LP sources at
large height (>20Rg) and Rout<1000 Rg, or with Rin>R_ISCO. The
spectral shape and therefore eventually fitting parameters were only
affected if <tt>fixReflFrac=1,2</tt> was set. Additionally, problems
with caching which sometimes occured when changing the inclination by
a large were also fixed.

[1.0.3] fixed relconv normalization (same now as for the previous
relxill version) and in <tt>relxilllpCp</tt> temperature is now
correctly given in the rest frame of the primary source

[1.0.2] solved segmentation fault if model was executed in folder
without write permission

[1.0.1]: added possiblity to change the re-normalization behaviour of
the models with the environment variable RENORM_RELXILL_MODEL.

[1.0.0]: first version of the new relxill model, including now
multiple zones for the LP-relxill model flavours. All other models
produce the same results, but all models are evaluated significantly
faster.
