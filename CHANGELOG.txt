[2.0]: major update: includes returning radiation (Dauser et al., 2022) and adds a switch to allow a boost parameter instead of reflection fraction. Some parameter names were slightly changed to make the naming more consistent. - 2022-06-16

[1.4.3]: fixes small memory leak for the Cp-models using the standard tables - 2021-01-22

[1.4.2]: fixes memory problems if a 6-dim table was used - 2021-01-21

[1.4.1]: corrects the (loose) definition of the reflection fraction in the relxill (non-LP) type models, which now directly follows the xillver/pexrav definition of the flux. This implies that the normalization (i.e., the flux) now depends on the inclination as F=1/2*cos(incl). - 2021-01-06


[v1.4.0] improves the interpolation of the xillver reflection spectra. This mainly affects the logN parameter and the relative normalization of xillverD and relxillD type models. - 2020-10-07

[v1.3.10] Cp-type models can again be loaded using the standard xillver reflection table (xillver-comp.fits) - 2020-08-03

[v1.3.9] fixes model sometimes crashing for a few, specific values of spin - 2020-07-10

[v1.3.7] restricts Incl < 87 degrees in the lmodel.dat to be consistent with the provided tables - 2020-04-15

[v1.3.5] works with new heasoft and stricter compiler options - 2019-10-17

[v1.3.3] new model relxilllpionCp added, which provides the ionization gradient and a moving primary source, but now also for the nthcomp primary continuum. - 2019-08-09

[v1.3.2] add "beta" parmeter (velocity of the primary source) to the relxilllpion model - 2019-08-02

[v1.3.0] ionization gradient and high density models
    - Included model relxilllpion predicting an ionization gradient (more information is given in the model section)
    - Update of the high-density models (xillverD, relxillD) to include a larger range in Gamma up to 3.6 (table is now xillverD-5.fits) - 2019-07-12

[1.2.1] Update density table to xillverD-5.fits and change number of
Gamma bins accordingly (now Gamma extends up to 3.6)

[v1.2.0] reverting the wrong change for the emissivity profile introduced by 1.1.0, change (1). Information on the update from 1.0.x to 1.2.0 can be found in this pdf. Besides this change, the environment variable RELLINE_PHYSICAL_NORM has been added. If set to 1, it will return the acutal normalization of the relline and relconv type models (not recommended for fitting). - 2018-08-07

[1.1.0] major update and bug fix for the lamp post version of relxill:

  (1) the emissivity profile in the lamp post geometry has been
    corrected, leading to a steeper radial dependency

  (2) fixing a wrong normalization of the reflected spectrum, mainly
  affecting models with a large inclination angle

  (3) removing the re-normalization with RENORM_RELXILL_MODEL

  (4) updating the relativistic table, to achieve a more precise
  calculation of relativstic blurring for very low inclinations

[1.0.4] only applies to the LP model flavors fixed inconsistencies and
problems with the normalization of the reflection component of
relxilllp</tt> and <tt>relxilllpCp</tt>, affecting only LP sources at
large height (>20Rg) and Rout<1000 Rg, or with Rin>R_ISCO. The
spectral shape and therefore eventually fitting parameters were only
affected if <tt>fixReflFrac=1,2</tt> was set. Additionally, problems
with caching which sometimes occured when changing the inclination by
a large were also fixed.

[1.0.3] fixed relconv normalization (same now as for the previous
relxill version) and in <tt>relxilllpCp</tt> temperature is now
correctly given in the rest frame of the primary source

[1.0.2] solved segmentation fault if model was executed in folder
without write permission

[1.0.1]: added possiblity to change the re-normalization behaviour of
the models with the environment variable RENORM_RELXILL_MODEL.

[1.0.0]: first version of the new relxill model, including now
multiple zones for the LP-relxill model flavours. All other models
produce the same results, but all models are evaluated significantly
faster.
